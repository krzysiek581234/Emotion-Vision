# Emotion-Vision
Artificial intelligence project

## Work plan:

### 1: Data preparation:
• Finding and downloading a suitable dataset containing face images with labels.
• Preparing scripts for data processing, such as scaling and rotating images to increase the number of training data.
### 2: Image processing:
• Applying face detection algorithms such as Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in images.
• Using data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, brightness adjustment, etc. to generate more training examples. 
### 3: Building CNN model:
• Creating and training a CNN model using machine learning tools such as Keras, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
• Selecting appropriate hyperparameters such as the number of layers, kernel size, and number of filters.
• Testing and optimizing the model using techniques such as cross-validation and regularization.
### 4: Implementation of the user interface:
• Creating a user interface that allows users to upload face images to the CNN model for emotion recognition.
• Testing the user interface to ensure it works correctly.
### 5: Optimization and deployment:
• Optimizing the model to run faster and take up less space.
### 6: Report:
• Preparing a project report containing a description of the problem, tools and technologies used, implementation description, test results, and conclusions.
• Presenting the project results in the form of a presentation to the project group.

## Date:
FER2013: dataset containing 35,887 facial images with seven emotion categories (anger, anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise).
